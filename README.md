#Angular Snippets

Code that's helped me develop in AngularJS

**/forms/**
- noneOfTheAbove.js
-- Enables a *None of the Above* checkbox which will deselect inputs :checked in the same div. Also deselects the *None of the Above* checkbox if a checkbox in that group becomes selected

**/services/**
- passPhoneToGet.js
-- Send a US phone number as a GET, using Base64.
